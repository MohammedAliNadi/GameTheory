# GameTheory
A repository for the purpose of uploading my final year project.
To play and see the code for the Tic Tac Toe game, visit this link or clone/download the repo and click on the "index.html" to access the game: https://editor.p5js.org/MohammedNadi/sketches/BwI_f8ahj
The other half of the game created in Unity is uploaded on wiseflow and will have instructions on how to execute the program.
